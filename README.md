# Maze-solver
This is a simple maze solver in Python. The program solves the problem using recursive methods. This project was done as part of a guided Python project that [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) offers.

Below is the maze solver in action. The path that is made is marked in Green and in case the code needs to revert its moves, then the backtracking is shown in Red.
